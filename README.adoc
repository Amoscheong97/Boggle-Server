## Introduction
I have created a server called Boggle Server that handles HTTP requests for clients who want to play the game.
In this README, I will be briefly summarize on what the server does and what are the actions it takes when it receives
a specific HTTP request. For deeper understanding of the Boggle Server, please refer to the code as there are comments to explain the mechanisms of the different lines of code.

## Prerequisite
The request sent to the Boggle Server must be of json content, else the server will reject the request.
There should be two internal test_board.txt and dictionary.txt files already existing within the server.

## Set up the Server

To set up the server, input the following at the command line:
```
py BoggleServer.py
```

After that, you should see the output :
```
Starting httpd on port 9000...
```

From here on, the server will wait for HTTP requests.

## How the server works
There are 3 HTTP requests that the game handles: POST, PUT, GET.

### POST request
POST request is sent when the client wants to play a new game of Boggle.
The JSON object sent to the server will be converted to a python dictionary. The server will check if the keys 'random' and 'duration' exists in the python dictionary. If either one is missing, the server will send a response code of 400 (Error) and json object with a key 'message' where it contains the message "Invalid Input".

* Example: `127.0.0.1 - - [03/Mar/2020 20:02:14] "POST /games HTTP/1.1" 400 -`
The number `400` represents the response code given by the user

If the key 'random' is true, the server will generate a random board else the server will add a new key called 'board' to the python dictionary.

Then, the server will add two more keys, 'id' and 'token'. There is a global variable that is incremented for every game created. For example, if the server just started, the global variable has a value of 1. The value 1 will be assigned to the first game created, then that global variable is incremented to 2, which means the next game will have a game ID of 2. 
The 'token' will be auto generated by the server the new value tht is auto-generated is the new token for that particular game.
After adding these keys, the python dictionary is converted back to JSON and sent back to the client with a response code of 201.

* Example: `127.0.0.1 - - [03/Mar/2020 20:02:10] "POST /games HTTP/1.1" 201 -`

### PUT request
The PUT request happens when the client start to play the game by putting in a new word.

Just like the POST request, the JSON object received by the user will be converted to a python dictionary. This time round, the server has to handle the game which the client wants to access. If the client wants to access the game with gameID 2, the path will be /games/2. The server will get the ID from the path and get the POSTed data previously added by client. The ID will also be validated in case it is an invalid ID. The amount of time left for the client is keep track as well. If the time spent by the client to play the game has exceeded the duration of the game, it will raise an error and sends a JSON object, telling the client that the game has ended.
The returned JSON object is as such : 
```
{
'message' : "Times Up! Game is no longer available",
'points_earned': *POINTS EARNED BY CLIENT*
}
```

Assuming now there are no errors received from the client, the server will proceed to check the dictionary and compare it to the word given by the client. It will also check if the word can be formed on the board. When both of these conditions are met, the client will accumulate points for that particular game. The accumulated points is based on the length of the word. For example, `tap` is worth 3 points and `final` is worth 5 points.

The POSTed data, given by the client, will be returned to the client, with a few adjustments. There will be a new key 'time_left' added to the JSON object, letting the client know the time left before the game expires. 

A successful PUT request is as such: 
`127.0.0.1 - - [03/Mar/2020 19:59:54] "PUT /games/4 HTTP/1.1" 200 -`

### GET request
In order to get the game information, a GET request is called.

The validation mechanism for PUT request and GET request are both the same. Both check if the ID given by the client is valid and if the game is already expired. The only thing different is that, once it retrieves the POSTed data, it edits the 'time_left' key of the python dictionary. Then it simply converts the dictionary to JSON object and returns to the client.

A successful GET request is as such: 
`127.0.0.1 - - [03/Mar/2020 20:00:17] "GET /games/7 HTTP/1.1" 200 -`
